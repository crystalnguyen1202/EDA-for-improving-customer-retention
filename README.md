# EDA-for-improving-customer-retention
Using SQL, PowerBI and Excel to analyze and investigate dataset of an e-commerce company.
## Situation
The Looker team created the fictional eCommerce clothes website TheLook using BigQuery Public Data on Google Cloud. This suggests that rather than being actual user data from an active website, the data is artificial or created to portray a hypothetical situation. The dataset is structured in a lengthy format and includes data on customers, items, orders, logistics, online events, and digital marketing activities. TheLook’s dataset is purposefully created to be fair and representative, free from any underlying biases or skewed distributions that may be present in data from the actual world.

## Task
In order to provide The Looker with useful insights from its datasets (which span the years 01-2019 to 04-2022), I carried out ad hoc jobs, created a dashboard, and carried out cohort analysis to guide TheLook’s business choices.
I used SQL (BigQuery), and PowerBI to finish this project.

## Action
### 1/ Ad-hoc tasks:
1.1 Total number of buyers and number of orders completed per month (from 01/2019 – to 04/2022)

Based on the results of this analysis, I found that the youngest customer was 12, the oldest customer was 70. Since then, I’ve divided customers by age into four main segments:
– Teenagers (12 – 19 years old)
– Young Adults (20 – 34 years old)
– Middle-Aged (35 – 54 years old)
– Older Adults (55 – 70 years old)
